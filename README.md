Helps in creating multidimensional databases for faster data analysis.

**SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**:

Focused on ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks.
Allows data integration from various sources into SQL Server databases.

**SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS)**:

Used for generating and managing reports based on SQL Server data.
Supports interactive and paginated reports.

**SQL Server Machine Learning Services**:

Allows running R and Python scripts directly on the database server.
Enables advanced analytics and machine learning models within the database environment.
